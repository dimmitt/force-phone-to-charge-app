# force-phone-to-charge

new phone app idea
<br/>it shuts off your phone
<br/>but it does more than that
<br/>you could say that it "bricks your phone under certain conditions"
<br/>tricks your phone to think the battery has run out
<br/>so you can only turn it back on by accessing a phone charger


this is probably impossible because not allowed by android or ios. 
<br/>but hopefully I can come up with a creative solution because I could use it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

What if it just spammed you ... 
<br/>"dont do it, shut your phone off as a notification message any time you unlocked your phone."
